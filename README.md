# GenSal
Scripts and functions generated in the framework of **GenSal** project, financed by the [University of Udine](www.uniud.it).
They were used to analyze dd-RAD sequencing data of *Salmo trutta* samples and obtain information on polymorphisms, genetic structure and signatures of selection.
The relevant paper is "ddRAD-seq reveals the genetic structure and detects signals of selection in Italian brown trout" and has been published in Genetics Selection  Evolution. You can freely access it from the [publisher](https://gsejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12711-022-00698-7).

We *tried* to put all the scripts and functions in the correct order.
The prefix **a** denotes the analysis devoted to genetic structure and detection of signatures, and the prefix **b** denotes analysis performed for the functional annotation of regions under selection and testing for enrichment in functional classes.
As a general rule, scripts are executed first, and they usually call R functions.
You will need to create a few path variables.
Scripts and functions are generally commented, and you should be able to walk your way throusgh them. 
If this is not the case, drop us a line.
